# `Mtconnect.AdapterInterface`
An assembly for implementing custom software Adapters capable of connecting with the reference [MTConnect&reg; Agent](https://github.com/mtconnect/cppagent).

The `Adapter` is a generic container for a set of `DataItem`s, state management, and string formatting (relative to the reference MTConnect&reg; Agent). See the `[TcpAdapter](../MtconnectCore.TcpAdapter)` for an example of how to implement this interface.
